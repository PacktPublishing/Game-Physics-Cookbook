# Game Physics Cookbook

This is the code repository for [Game Physics Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/game-physics-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787123663), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Physics are really important for game programmers who want to add realism and functionality to their games. Collision detection especially is a problem that affects all game developers, regardless of the platform, engine, or toolkit they use.

This book will teach you the concepts and formulas behind collision detection. You will also be taught how to build a simple physics engine, where Rigid Body physics is the main focus, and get to learn about intersection algorithms for primitive shapes.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
#ifndef _H_MATH_VECTORS_
#define _H_MATH_VECTORS_
// Structure definitions
// Method declarations
#endif#ifndef _H_MATH_VECTORS_
#define _H_MATH_VECTORS_
// Structure definitions
// Method declarations
#endif
```
### Software and Hardware List
Working knowledge of the C++ language is required for this book, as the book is not a tutorial
about programming. Having a basic understanding of calculus and linear algebra will be
useful, but is not required. You will need a Windows PC (preferably with Windows 7 or higher)
with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 installed on it.
